- Advanced preprocessing: Comprehensive data cleaning and feature engineering
- Class imbalance handling: SMOTE implementation for balanced training
- Model optimization: Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance

***Dataset***
- File: student_dataset.csv
- Type: E-commerce transaction records
- Target Variable: Is.Fraudulent (1 = Fraudulent, 0 = Legitimate)

***Methodology***

The project follows a systematic approach to fraud detection:

- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Handling class imbalance with SMOTE
- Model selection and evaluation
